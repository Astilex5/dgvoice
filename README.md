# dgVoice : Add music playback support to Discordgo.

Include this along with Discordgo to add the ability to play audio files
to a server/channel.

You must have ffmpeg in your path and Opus libs already installed.

This is very incomplete and barely tested code.  Please understand that it
might not work and might have little glitches.  It does work on my system and
sounds pretty decent.

Please send feedback on any performance improvements that can be made for 
sound quality, stability, or efficiency.
