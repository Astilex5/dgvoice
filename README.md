# dgVoice: music support for Discordgo.

Include this along with Discordgo to add the ability to play audio files
to a voice channel on Discord.

* You must have ffmpeg in your path and Opus libs already installed.
* You must use Discordgo 0.9.0-alpha or newer

This has been updated recently and should be more stable however it should still
be considered an example / proof of concept.  It is not complete and it will have
substantial changes in the future.

Please send feedback on any performance improvements that can be made for 
sound quality, stability, or efficiency.


# Usage Example
See playfile.go in the example folder of this repo.
